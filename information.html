                            Therapy is important – it works in similar ways as taking precautions to avoid long term illness or distress. We believe it is precautionary measures to help cope with life in this technologically advanced world where there is not much in our control, making us feel completely lost. It also helps on a weekly basis to get your thoughts out, rejuvenate your mind and continue with a fresher outlook.

                        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
                            We believe in cognitive restructuring in a way where we want to help replace the negative thoughts into positive ones, so one feels more in control of their own journey. We also believe in letting you take the first step into the whole therapy process, so you know you are the one holding the steering and we will help guide the best path possible.

                            We believe in providing a space where you can be vulnerable about any aspect of life because we believe everything contributes to something. This is more an exploration space for you to just map out your thoughts, actions without any judgement and connect the dots, find a pattern and help figure out a path that works for you.

                            Growing up, we have seen countless cases of people going through an emotional turmoil. We realised there was such a huge gap between children who are able to talk in supportive spaces and children who had to grow up on their own. We are strong believers in childhood burdens/trauma unfolding and distressing in adulthood is one of the major reasons why some patterns of individuals are so rigid to changes, proving to be harmful. But these patterns can be replaced with healthier outlooks, behaviors, thought processes. We personally have worked with and assisted individuals going through issues that are deeply rooted in their upbringing, culture, environmental conditions and also peers they have been with. We believe that talking about the issues from every angle gives us depth and clarity and also a sense of relief that at least it is out there. You'd realise you are really not the only one.
